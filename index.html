       <h5>Here are some facts about Mother Teresa:</h5>
         <ul>
           <li>Full name: Agnes Gonxha Bejaxhiu</li>
           <li>Born in Skopje, a small town in Albania (Yugoslavia)</li>
           <li>by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life</li>
           <li>She left home at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English. She never saw her family after that</li>
           <li>She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries</li>
           <li>In 1950 she founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_of_Charity" target="_blank">The Missionaries of Charity</em></a></li>
           <li>The congregation manages homes for people dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis; soup kitchens; dispensaries and mobile clinics; children's- and family-counselling programmes; orphanages, and schools.</li>
           <li>She was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016.</li>

       <blockquote>
       <p>Her mission in her own words:</p>
       <p><em>"Our mission was to care for the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to society and are shunned by everyone."</em></p>
       </blockquote>
